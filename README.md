# Blackjack

Tests and solutions for Stanford's CS221 class. My part of code is in 'submission.py' file between 'BEGIN_YOUR_CODE' and 'END_YOUR_CODE'. Tests can be executed by running 'grader.py' file. More information about the assignment can be found by opening 'index.html' file. Solutions to the written part of the assignments are not published but I am happy to discuss them in person.  
This specific repo is focused on Markov Decision Processes, modeling a sligthly modified game of Blackjack as a MDP, defining successor states, probabilities and rewards as well as using the rewards for improving the optimal strategy.
Optimal strategy is found using the Q-Learning algorithm. As the game of Blackjack (with a standard deck) can have a very high set if possible states and successor states we can use the fact that simillar states require simillar actions. This fact is used in implementing a feature extractor function which takes a specific state and returns its features. Recieved results are used in improving the optimal strategy by updating the weights of a given extracted feature.  (Example: Having a King and Queen is not much different from having a King and Jack in Blackjack).
